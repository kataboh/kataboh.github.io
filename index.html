	<br>
	<p>
		I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Delaware in the Department of Mathematical Sciences.
		The primary focus of my research is to find out what role Hox genes play in colorectal cancer (CRC) by using mathematical modeling and scientific machine learning. 
		My work has the potential to significantly advance cancer research and help those who are affected by CRC.

  I was born and raised in Accra, Ghana, and graduated from the University of Cape Coast in 2016 with a BSc in Mathematics and Economics. I then earned my MS in Mathematics from Ohio University in 2019. Outside of school activities, I enjoy playing soccer, cooking, spending time with friends, and entertaining my little girl.
