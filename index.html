	<br>
	<p>
		I am currently a Visiting Assistant Professor in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Swarthmore College and recently completed my Ph.D. in applied mathematics at the University of Delaware, where I also earned a master’s degree in data science. My research focuses on understanding the role of HOX genes in colorectal cancer through mathematical modeling and scientific machine learning. This work aims to advance mechanistic insight into cancer progression and contribute to the development of more effective treatment strategies.

  I was born and raised in Accra, Ghana, and graduated from the University of Cape Coast in 2016 with a BSc in Mathematics and Economics. I then earned my MS in Mathematics from Ohio University in 2019. Outside of school activities, I enjoy playing soccer, cooking, spending time with friends, and entertaining my little girl.
