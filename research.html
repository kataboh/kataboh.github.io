		Cancer remains one of the most challenging puzzles in medical and biological research. My current work under the supervision of Dr. Gilberto Schleiniger is inherently interdisciplinary, exploring molecular pathways that lead to the progression of colon cancer and developing treatment strategies. Specifically, I use mathematical modeling and analysis to simulate multiple cellular pathways, i.e., HOX, WNT, and RA, that regulate cancer development, with a particular focus on colorectal cancer. This research is complemented by laboratory experiments conducted at ChristianaCareâ€™s Helen F. Graham Cancer Center & Research Institute in Newark, DE, under the supervision of my experimental co-advisor, Bruce M. Boman (M.D., Ph.D., MSPH, FACP).
