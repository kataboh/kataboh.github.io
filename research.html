	<font size="4"><b>Introduction:</b></font><br>
		Cancer remains one of the most challenging puzzles in medical research. 
		I am part of the University of Delaware cancer research group, which includes several mathematicians and biologists. My current work under the supervision of Dr. Gilberto Schleiniger is inherently interdisciplinary, exploring molecular pathways that lead to the progression of colon cancer and developing treatment strategies. Specifically, I use mathematical modeling and analysis to simulate multiple cellular pathways, i.e., HOX, WNT, and RA, that regulate cancer development, with a particular focus on colorectal cancer. This research is complemented by laboratory experiments conducted at ChristianaCareâ€™s Helen F. Graham Cancer Center & Research Institute in Newark, DE, under the supervision of my experimental co-advisor, Bruce M. Boman (M.D., Ph.D., MSPH, FACP).

		Building upon the established frameworks, I developed a comprehensive reaction-diffusion model. This wasn't just another mathematical representation; it was a tool that incorporated the effects of mechanical stress, the inherent randomness of biological interactions (stochasticity), and the modulatory role of retinoids. The inclusion of the Gillespie algorithm allowed us to capture the unpredictability of molecular interactions, while our exploration of mechanical forces unveiled the intriguing idea that physical stresses could expose HOX genes to specific domains, potentially triggering their expression.

		Several fascinating patterns emerged from the data. Firstly, the spatio-temporal profiles for HOXA5, Wnt, and Cancer Stem Cells (CSCs) exhibited unique concentration distributions. Introducing retinoids to the mix changed these patterns, shedding light on their potential therapeutic applications. Mechanical stresses, often overlooked in traditional models, stood out as significant influencers of HOXA5 expression. The stochastic model revealed another layer of complexity, emphasizing that even under nearly identical conditions, molecular randomness can lead to divergent outcomes.
