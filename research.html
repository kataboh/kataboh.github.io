	<font size="4"><b>Introduction:</b></font><br>
		Cancer remains one of the most challenging puzzles in medical research. While we've amassed vast knowledge about individual cogs in the machinery, understanding how they come together remains elusive. My recent research endeavored to fill this gap by investigating the interactions between HOXA5, a known tumor suppressor, and Wnt, a signaling pathway with key roles in tumorigenesis.

	<font size="4"><b>Model Development:</b></font><br><br>
		Building upon the established frameworks, I developed a comprehensive reaction-diffusion model. This wasn't just another mathematical representation; it was a tool that incorporated the effects of mechanical stress, the inherent randomness of biological interactions (stochasticity), and the modulatory role of retinoids. The inclusion of the Gillespie algorithm allowed us to capture the unpredictability of molecular interactions, while our exploration of mechanical forces unveiled the intriguing idea that physical stresses could expose HOX genes to specific domains, potentially triggering their expression.

	<font size="4"><b>Key Insights:</b></font><br>
		Several fascinating patterns emerged from the data. Firstly, the spatio-temporal profiles for HOXA5, Wnt, and Cancer Stem Cells (CSCs) exhibited unique concentration distributions. Introducing retinoids to the mix changed these patterns, shedding light on their potential therapeutic applications. Mechanical stresses, often overlooked in traditional models, stood out as significant influencers of HOXA5 expression. The stochastic model revealed another layer of complexity, emphasizing that even under nearly identical conditions, molecular randomness can lead to divergent outcomes.

	This project was more than just equations and simulations; it was a foray into the intricate dance of molecules and cells that govern cancer's genesis and progression. With this foundation, the next steps will involve grounding the model with experimental data and further refining its parameters. The ultimate goal? To piece together the cancer puzzle and lay the groundwork for innovative therapeutic strategies. This research represents a step in that direction, and I am excited about the possibilities it unveils.
