    <p>Cancer remains one of the most challenging puzzles in medical and biological research. 
    My current work under the supervision of Dr. Gilberto Schleiniger is inherently interdisciplinary, 
    exploring molecular pathways that lead to the progression of colon cancer and developing treatment strategies.
    Specifically, I use mathematical modeling and analysis to simulate multiple cellular pathways, i.e., HOX, WNT, and RA, 
    that regulate cancer development, with a particular focus on colorectal cancer. 
    This research is complemented by laboratory experiments conducted at ChristianaCare’s Helen F. Graham Cancer Center & Research Institute in Newark, DE, 
    under the supervision of my experimental co-advisor, Bruce M. Boman (M.D., Ph.D., MSPH, FACP).</p>

		<br>

	<p><em>Hox</em> genes are critical transcription factors that play a central role in both embryonic development and tumorigenesis. In humans, <em>39 Hox genes</em> are grouped into four clusters—<em>HOXA</em>, <em>HOXB</em>, <em>HOXC</em>, and <em>HOXD</em>—located on chromosomes 7, 17, 12, and 2, respectively. <p>

	<p>Recent research by collaborators at the Helen F. Graham Cancer Center & Research Institute at Christiana Care has identified <em>HOXA5</em> and <em>HOXA13</em> as key regulators of the WNT and RA pathways. Depending on the underlying biological mechanisms, these genes can either promote or suppress colon tumor formation.

     Our research focuses on understanding the role of these Hox genes in colorectal cancer by developing mathematical models to investigate their interactions with pathways such as WNT and RA. Through these models, we aim to identify vulnerable mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets to guide effective interventions.</p>
